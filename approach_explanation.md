# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

Our system implements a three-stage semantic analysis pipeline designed to extract and prioritize document sections based on specific personas and their job-to-be-done requirements. The approach combines advanced natural language processing with intelligent content filtering to deliver highly relevant results within strict performance constraints.

## Technical Architecture

### Stage 1: Document Parsing and Section Extraction
The system begins by processing PDF documents using PyMuPDF to extract structured content. Each document is parsed to identify logical sections with their corresponding page numbers and titles. This stage handles diverse document formats including research papers, textbooks, reports, and guides while maintaining the original document structure and metadata.

### Stage 2: Semantic Relevance Ranking
The core ranking engine employs Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to compute semantic similarity between content and persona-specific queries. The system constructs context-aware queries by combining the persona role with the specific task requirements. For example, a "PhD Researcher in Computational Biology" seeking to "prepare a literature review" generates a query that emphasizes methodological details, datasets, and performance benchmarks.

The ranking algorithm uses cosine similarity scoring with additional optimization strategies:
- **Diversity Penalty**: Reduces duplicate document selections by applying a 0.05 penalty for repeated source documents
- **Quality Filtering**: Removes sections under 100 characters or containing generic terms like "introduction" or "general info"
- **Content Enhancement**: Combines section titles with detailed content for comprehensive semantic analysis

### Stage 3: Output Generation and Formatting
The final stage transforms ranked sections into the required JSON structure with comprehensive metadata. The system generates both extracted sections (with importance rankings) and subsection analysis (with refined text content) to provide both high-level overview and detailed insights.

## Key Innovation: Persona-Aware Query Building

The system's most distinctive feature is its intelligent query construction mechanism. Rather than using simple keyword matching, it builds contextual queries that reflect the persona's expertise level, domain knowledge, and specific task requirements. This approach enables the system to distinguish between similar content based on relevance to different user types.

For instance, the same financial data might be ranked differently for an "Investment Analyst" versus a "Business Student" based on their respective expertise levels and information needs. The query building process incorporates domain-specific terminology and task-oriented language to maximize semantic alignment.

## Performance Optimization

The implementation prioritizes efficiency while maintaining accuracy:
- **Model Selection**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 provides excellent performance-to-size ratio (80MB)
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple documents and sections
- **Memory Management**: Optimized tensor operations and garbage collection
- **CPU Optimization**: Leverages PyTorch's CPU-optimized operations

## Scalability and Generalization

The system's generic design enables it to handle diverse document types and personas without retraining. The semantic approach naturally adapts to new domains, making it suitable for academic research, business analysis, educational content, and other specialized use cases. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization while maintaining the core ranking logic.

This methodology ensures robust performance across varied scenarios while meeting all technical constraints including CPU-only processing, model size limitations, and real-time processing requirements.
